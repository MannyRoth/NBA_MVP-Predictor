# 2021 Predictin NBA MVP Predictor using Twitter API

When it comes to any award given based on a group of voters, popularity may matter more than 
their aptitude for said award. In this model I wanted to compare stastical aptitude to popularity for which 
had a greater effect on the outcome.






## Methodology

I used a predictor model that was created using scrapped data from the NBA since 1991. 
Using that Data I made my predicting model which had a mAP of 71%.

Going into the project I didn't expect to be to get the mAP very high while using the data and a Random Forest Predicint Model.
So I had already planned on using Data from Twitters API to help in predicting this past years MVP.

The Data alone predicted Giannis winning but after adding in the amount of Tweets the had both #NBAMVP 
and the players name it showed that Nikola Jokic was much more favored by the public as a whole and in the end, 
as my model also showed, Jokic won the award.
